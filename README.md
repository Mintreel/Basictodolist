# Basictodolist
Basic webapp with backend functions similar to windows sticky notes application. Main aspect was fiddling around with Django python backend

## Intro
This is a basic webapp without CSS or JS (looks very ugly), but the purpose of this was to develop my understanding of using the python based backend, Django. So I decided a todo list webapp that stores your todo items and allows you to write, edit and delete your notes upon completion.
